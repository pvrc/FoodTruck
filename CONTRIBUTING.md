# Contribution Guide
Thanks for your interest in contributing to Food Truck's development! Please follow these instructions to help
your pull request merged in as fast as possible!

Cloning the directory can be done with by running `git clone https://github.com/anacat/unity-mergetool.git` in
your terminal, or cloning the directory through your favorite git tool. Once you have the files on your computer,
you will need to install [Unity Smart Merge](https://github.com/anacat/unity-mergetool) into your `.git/config`
file. If you need to merge any Unity .scene files, you'll have to use `git mergetool` in your terminal, or through 
your GUI. By default, you will be on the master branch. To begin development, make a new branch by using
`git branch new-branch-name` with the branch name being related to the feature that you're developing. Once you've
made enough commits, create a new [pull request](https://github.com/pvrc/FoodTruck/pulls) to get your feature merged
into master. The master branch is the default public-facing branch and should always be working and bug-free once your contribution is merged.

If you have any questions, you can email the principal maintainer of this repository. Thanks!
